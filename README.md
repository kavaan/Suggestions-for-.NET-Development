Api Gateway
Ocelot: lightweight API gateway that helps to build scalable and secure microservices architecture.
Kong: open-source API gateway that enables developers to manage, secure, and observe their APIs and services.

Unit testing
xUnit: open-source unit testing framework for .NET Core and .NET Framework.
NUnit: unit testing framework for .NET that provides a simple, powerful way to write and run unit tests.
Shouldly: fluent assertion library that provides a more readable way to write unit tests in .NET.
FakeitEasy: lightweight mocking library for .NET that makes it easy to create and use mocks in unit tests.

Secret Management
Vault: tool for managing secrets and sensitive data in distributed systems.

Network
DotNetty: high-performance network application framework for building scalable and performant applications on the .NET platform.

Audio
NAudio: library for audio programming in .NET that enables developers to record, play, and manipulate audio data.

Message Bus
MassTransit: open-source distributed application framework for .NET that provides a message-based architecture for building scalable and resilient systems.

Videos & Images
FFmpegCore: .NET Core wrapper for the FFmpeg multimedia framework, which enables developers to work with audio and video files.
Magic.NET: Powerful image manipulation library that supports over 100 major file formats.
ImageSharp: cross-platform image processing library for .NET that enables developers to manipulate and transform images.

VS Code Extensions
Roslynator: collection of analyzers, refactorings, and code fixes for C# that help to improve the quality and maintainability of code.
GitHub Copilot: AI-powered code assistant that provides suggestions for completing code based on natural language inputs.
QuickType: tool for generating strongly-typed code from JSON data.
REST Client: REST Client allows developer to send HTTP request and view the response in Visual Studio Code directly.

Search Engines
Elasticsearch: distributed search and analytics engine that enables developers to build powerful search applications.
Solr: open-source search platform that provides a fast and scalable search engine for building search applications.

String Matching
StringSimilarity: library for measuring the similarity between strings using different algorithms and metrics.
FuzzySharp: fuzzy string matching library for .NET that provides a more flexible and forgiving way to match strings.

Design Patterns
CQRS: A design pattern for building scalable and performant applications that separates the read and write operations into separate models.
Factory Method: A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
Mediator: A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to decouple components of a system by allowing them to communicate through a mediator object.
Builder: A creational design pattern that provides a way to create complex objects by breaking them down into smaller, simpler objects and then combining them together.

I hope that these tools and the mentioned items will help developers in designing a better software.
